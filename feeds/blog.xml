            <title>OpenBSD: A Robust and Secure Operating System for the Future</title>
            <link>./../articles/openbsd.html</link>
            <description>Since its inception, OpenBSD has stood out as a UNIX-like operating system
                based on 4.4BSD, known for its security as well as its minimalist design. This
                article explores its philosophy of security and simplicity, key security
